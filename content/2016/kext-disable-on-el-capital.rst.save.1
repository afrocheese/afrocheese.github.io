    Let's disable some kext

Introduction
------------
OS X has recently made it more difficult to load arbitrary KEXT which is great for security, but it's very annoying when you're trying to developer a driver. 

What to do
----------
If you're running 10.10, 

The first step is to boot into recovery mode (instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314). tldr; Reboot and hold Command+r. 



Once in Recovery Mode, bring up Terminal and run the following commands. I'm not sure if the first one is required, but it's the way I did it, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

.. code-block:: bash

    $ csrutil disable
    Successfully disabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
    $ csrutil enable --without kext
    csrutil: requesting an unsupported configuration. This is likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.
    Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
